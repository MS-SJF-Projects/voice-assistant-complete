# Voice Assistant tutorial

This is a hands-on workshop where you will develop, from scratch, a Voice Assistant.

You will learn how to implement it like a professional developer: write code, build automation to test and deploy the project, manage secrets and security concerns. You will get familiar with Python (for coding), GitHub, Docker and Azure (cloud provider to host our application and its resources).
